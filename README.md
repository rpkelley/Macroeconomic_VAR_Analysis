# Macroeconomic_VAR_Analysis
Using a vector autoregression model in R to examine macroeconomic sensitivities.

First we calibrate a macroeconomic VAR model based on three times series variables: the Federal Funds rate, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the unemployment rate.

Then we insert a "shock" to one of these variables, and observe how the rest of the system responds.

This walkthrough illustrates the usefulness of this tool for examining how the macro environment might change due to an unexpected impulse.
